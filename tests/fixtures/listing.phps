This adorable pinafore is constructed perfect pink and white polka dotted cotton. The skirt is a generous bell shape with gathers around the wide waist waistband. Two roomy pockets adorn either side of the skirt. The suspenders, waistband, and midpanel are lined with cotton. The skirt is unlined. This pinafore features a zipper closure at the back, and the straps cross in back to ensure no slipping. Black stitching accents the entire piece. 

The &quot;waist&quot; on this pinafore typically sits just below the bust. The fabric has very little give so please be sure that you can live with 25.5”.

This piece is absolutely unique and one of a kind. This garment has been constructed out of reclaimed or second-hand fabric, which means that the material was purchased uncut from a thrift store, not that it’s from a previously existing piece of clothing. These measurements are precise—remember to figure in breathing room!

**Please note: I always recommend hand-washing each of my pieces in cool water. Since all of my fabric is “found” I’m often guessing as to fabric content, and gentle washing in cool water is the best way to care for most fabrics, and all handmade pieces!
